# Prompt-to-Skill Converter with Grok

**Why This Skill Exists**  
Many people repeatedly type the same long, detailed prompts every time they want their AI to do something. Over time this becomes tedious, inconsistent, and error-prone. The same request can produce very different results depending on how it’s phrased that day. This skill solves that problem by converting those repetitive prompts into proper, reusable SKILL.md files that the agent can load reliably.

## What You'll Gain

- Turn ad-hoc prompts into structured, reusable skills
- More consistent and reliable results from your AI
- A growing library of personal skills instead of scattered prompts
- Better understanding of what makes a skill effective
- Reduced typing and context switching

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- You find yourself writing the same (or very similar) prompt repeatedly
- You have a workflow or task you do often with an AI and want to make it more reliable
- You want to turn a useful prompt into something you can reuse across projects or sessions
- You notice your results are inconsistent for a particular type of request

**When You DON’T Need This Skill**
- You’re asking a one-off question that you don’t expect to repeat
- You’re still exploring or figuring out what you want (this skill works best when the prompt already produces decent results)
- You want to improve an existing SKILL.md (use Skill Evaluation & Iteration instead)

## Agent Operating Procedure

When this skill is activated, you **MUST** follow this structured process.

### Phase 1: Capture the Current Prompting Behavior
Extract or ask for the exact prompt or pattern the user keeps using. Understand:
- What the user is trying to achieve
- What a good output looks like
- What context or information the user usually provides

**Stop here** and confirm the core use case with the user before proceeding.

### Phase 2: Extract Core Components
Identify the essential parts of the prompt:
- Purpose (what problem does this solve?)
- Trigger conditions (when should this be used?)
- Boundaries (what should it NOT do?)
- Input requirements
- Desired output format

### Phase 3: Design the Skill Structure
Define a clean SKILL.md structure:
- Clear name and description
- Explicit “When to Use” and “When You DON’T Need This Skill” sections
- Well-defined Agent Operating Procedure with phases and stop conditions
- Strong Expected Output template
- Appropriate guardrails and anti-patterns

### Phase 4: Generate the SKILL.md
Produce a complete, ready-to-use SKILL.md file based on the user’s prompt.

### Phase 5: Suggest Improvements & Next Steps
Offer light suggestions for making the skill even stronger and recommend the natural next step (usually Skill Evaluation & Iteration or Agensi Skill Authoring for deeper foundations).

### Completed Example

```markdown
## Converted Skill

**Skill Name**  
PR Description Writer

**Description**  
Turns rough notes about a change into a clear, professional, well-structured pull request description.

**When to Use**  
When you have finished implementing a feature or fix and want to write a good PR description quickly.

**When You DON’T Need This Skill**  
For tiny one-line changes or when you’re still in the middle of development.

**Agent Operating Procedure**  
1. Ask for a summary of the change and the problem it solves.
2. Identify key files changed and why they matter.
3. Generate a structured PR description with context, changes, and testing notes.
4. Suggest a good title.

**Expected Output**  
A ready-to-copy PR description in markdown.

**Notes & Suggestions**  
Consider adding a “Testing Done” section if the user often forgets it.
```

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Don’t Do This                              | Do This Instead                                      |
|--------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Turning every small prompt into a skill    | Only convert prompts that are used repeatedly        |
| Keeping the original prompt too vague      | Extract clear purpose, triggers, and output format   |
| Making the skill too broad                 | Keep the scope focused on the original use case      |
| Forgetting to add “When NOT to Use”        | Always define boundaries clearly                     |

## Quick Start Prompt

```
I keep using this prompt over and over:

[paste your repetitive prompt here]

Please apply the Prompt-to-Skill Converter with Grok and turn this into a proper, reusable SKILL.md file.
```

## Works Well With

- **Agensi Skill Authoring** (free) — Learn the foundations of good skill design before or after converting prompts
- **Skill Evaluation & Iteration with Grok** ($5) — After converting prompts into skills, use this to score and systematically improve them
- **Iterating Agensi Skills** (free) — Lightweight companion for quick reviews of newly converted skills
- **Skill Health Scanner** (free) — Quickly audit the quality of skills you’ve created from prompts
- **Task Finisher with Grok** (free) — Turn prompt-to-skill conversion into reliable, well-documented output

## Compatibility

This skill follows the open SKILL.md standard and is specifically optimized for **Grok** inside the **Grok Build CLI / TUI**.
