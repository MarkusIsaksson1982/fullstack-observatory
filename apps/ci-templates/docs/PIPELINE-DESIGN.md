# Pipeline Design - Layer 7

## Why These Stages, In This Order

Every CI/CD pipeline in The Full Stack Observatory follows the same progression:

```text
1. Lint     -> Catch code quality issues (fastest, cheapest)
2. Test     -> Verify correctness (fast, catches logic errors)
3. Build    -> Produce artifacts (Docker image, bundle)
4. Security -> Audit dependencies, scan for vulnerabilities
5. Deploy   -> Push to production (only on main, after all gates pass)
```

### Fail Fast Principle

Stages are ordered by **speed** and **cost**. Linting takes seconds and catches
formatting issues that would waste time in later stages. Tests take longer but
catch real bugs. Building and security scanning are heavier. Deployment only
happens if everything passes.

### Reusable Workflows

GitHub Actions `workflow_call` lets repos reference shared workflows. This means:
- One place to update CI logic (this repo)
- All Observatory repos get the same quality gates
- New repos inherit best practices by default

### Cross-Repo Consistency

| Repo | Workflows Used |
|------|----------------|
| fullstack-api-server | node-ci, security-scan |
| fullstack-containerized | docker-build |
| fullstack-infrastructure | terraform-plan |
| fullstack-security-hardened | node-ci, security-scan |
| fullstack-monitoring | node-ci |
